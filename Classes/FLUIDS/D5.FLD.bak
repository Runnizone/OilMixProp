!The fluid files contain general information about the fluid in the first 15 to 20 lines, followed by sections for the
! equations of state, transport equations, and auxiliary equations.  Equations of state are listed first.  The NIST recommended
! equations begin with a hash mark (#).  The secondary equations begin with the @ symbol.  These symbols can be swapped to
! select a secondary equation as primary and the primary as secondary.  The equation of state section also contains auxiliary
! equations for the ideal gas heat capacity or ideal gas Helmholtz energy.  Below the equations of state (both primary and
! secondary) are the transport equations, first viscosity and then thermal conductivity.  These are then followed by the
! secondary equations if available.  The transport section also contains auxiliary equations required to calculate either the
! dilute gas state or the critical enhancement.  At the end of the file are additional but not necessary auxiliary equations,
! including simple equations for the vapor pressure, saturated liquid and vapor densities, melting line (for some fluids), and
! sublimation line (for even fewer fluids).  This section also contains the equations for dielectric constant and surface
! tension if available.  The sections are divided by different symbols (these being _-+=^*~) to aid the eye in locating a
! particular section.  Secondary equations are indented 10 spaces to avoid confusion with the NIST recommended equations.  The
! end of the fluid file is marked with @END.  Anything below that is ignored.
