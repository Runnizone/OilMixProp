Welcome to OilMixProp 1.0, a software package for important thermophysical properties of oils, common liquids and their mixtures.

Key functions of OilMixProp 1.0:
1. Users can define their own oils (fuels, lubricants or other oil variants) using the fitting tools.
2. Inputs and outputs are specifically designed for the analysis of thermodynamic cycles.
3. So far 632 pure fluids with unlimited user-defined oils are available.
4. Key properties: density, phase behavior, heat capacity, entropy, enthalpy, speed of sound, viscosity, and thermal conductivity.

Model within OilMixProp 1.0:
1. Cubic EoS: Yang-Frotscher-Richter, Patel-Teja Valderrama, Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson.
2. State-of-the-art residual entropy scaling (RES) for viscosity and thermal conductivity.
3. A robust flash algorithm to guarantee reliable and stable liquid-vapor equilibrium calculations.
