Interface User GuideSteps to Use
1. Click the "Density data" Button
Locate and click the "Density data" button on the interface to enter the data management section.
2. Select the "ExpData" Folder
After clicking the "Density data" button, a file selection window will pop up. Please select the "ExpData" folder in this window.
3. Create a Fluid Folder
In the "ExpData" folder, users need to create a new folder for each measured fluid. Name the folder after the fluid. For example, if the measured fluid is water, name the folder "Water".
4. Add Measurement Data
In the named fluid folder, users need to place the measurement data in txt files. The measurement data includes the following categories:
•Density (required)
•Fluid_Constants_xxx (xxx is the fluid name)
•HeatCapacity
•ThermalConductivity
•VaporPressure
•Viscosity
Each data type should be placed in a separate txt file and named accordingly. For example, density data should be in a file named "Density.txt".
5. Save the Data
Save all the relevant txt files into the corresponding fluid folder.
6. Select and View Data
Once the data is saved, users only need to select the "Density" file under the "ExpData" folder to retrieve all the measurement data within that folder.
